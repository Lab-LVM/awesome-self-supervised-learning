## Introduce 
<img width="600" alt="model" src="./img/SwAV_overall.png">

- This paper suggests a new computationally efficient method for constructing low-dimensional representation of unlabeled data.
- Contrastive learning is a powerful method to learn visual features without supervision.
- Instead of predicting a label associated with an image, contrastive methods train convolutional networks by discriminating between images.
- This approach works well but requires the system to transform the same image in many different ways and compare individually every individually every possible pair of trasformed images.
- This is an extremely computation intensive task.
- So, SwAV propose an alternative that does not require an explicit comparison between every image pair.
- Fisrt compute features of cropped sections of two images and assign each of them to a cluster of images.
- These assignments are done independently and may not match for example, the black-and-white image version of the cat image could be a match with a cluster that contains different cat images.
- Constrain the two cluster assignmednts to match over time, so the system eventually will discover that all the images of cats represent the same information.
- SwAV allows researchers to train efficient, high-performance image classification models with no annotations or metadata.

## Experiment Results.
- SwAV repersentation outperforms supervised representation
